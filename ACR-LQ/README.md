ACR-LQ is a package of codes to generate a quadratic approximation to the
welfare function and solve for the correct first order approximation solution
to the optimal policy problem. It also checks the second order conditions.

The codes were developed for  
**Altissimo, F., CÃºrdia, V., and Rodriguez-Palenzuela, D. (2005)**
[Linear-Quadratic Approximation to Optimal Policy: An Algorithm and Two Applications](https://github.com/vcurdia/ACR-LQ/blob/master/ACR2005-LQ-Paper.pdf) 
Unpublished, European Central Bank and Princeton University.

The codes implement the linear-quadratic approximation method described in  
**Benigno, P. and Woodford, M. (2012)**

# Description of main files

`LQGenSymVar.m`

Creates symbolic variables needed in other routines. See example in order to 
see when to call this script.

`LQ.m`

Main LQ code. It computes synmbolic derivatives and generates all the symbolic
matrices needed to implement optimal policy, including the quadratic 
approximation to the welfare function and the first order approximation to the
laws of motion of the economy.

`LQSolveREE.m`

After replacing the output matrices from LQ with steady state values, this code
solves for the REE equilibrium using gensys routine created by Chris Sims and 
available through his website.

`LQCheckSOC.m` and `LQCheckSOCAlt.m`

Two alternative codes to check for verification of the second order conditions.

`LQAltRule.m`

Computes the REE under an alternative policy rule submitted in non-linear form.

`LQAltRuleLinear.m`
Computes the REE under an alternative policy rule submitted in linear form.

`LQWEval`

Evaluates the welfare value of a given policy rule. 
Current limitation: assumes that policies are stationary.


# Example:

The package also includes an example (in folder Example) showing how to use the
codes. The example's main script is the file `MonFrictions.m` which sets up the
model framework and calls other functions and scripts.

The codes in the examples are the following:

`MonFrictions.m`

Example's main script. Sets the required variables and equations. Solves for
the optimal steady state using the csolve numerical solution to systems of 
non-linear equations created by Chris Sims and available through his website.
then calls the `LQ` function. Replaces the symbolic matrices with numerical 
steady state values and then solves for the REE solution under optimal policy
using `LQSolveREE`. It also computes the IRF for all variables in response to
all of the shocks. It also computes the value of welfare under optimal and
simple rule. Finally it saves all the output in a mat file.

`MonFrictionsIRFPlot.m`

Plots the IRFs. This is an example of how to make simple plots of the IRF.

`MonFrictionsIRFPlotAltRule.m`

Plots the optimal policy against the alternative rule.

`MonFrictionsIRFPlotComp.m`

Generates comparison plots for alternative calibrations of the model.
